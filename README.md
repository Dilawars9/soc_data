# SOC Data Extractor

This repository contains a Python script to extract specific spin-orbit coupling (SOC) data from a file with a defined format. The extracted data is saved to a new file, with transition information and SOC values in cm⁻¹.

## Features

- **Pattern Matching**: Extracts transitions and SOC values based on a custom format.
- **Dynamic Output Naming**: Saves output with a filename based on the input file name.
- **Verbose Mode**: Optionally displays additional information during execution for debugging.
- **Error Handling**: Validates the input file and handles missing files or unmatched patterns.
